# SS13 Branding

SS13 is a [weird game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L-CYkXmJzw). It has a whole bunch of lore we're trying to rewrite and a shitton of other stuff we're trying to implement sooner than later. Stay tuned. 

For now, all you need to know is the following:

##Color Scheme

###Canus Nebula Outpost

The Wolf part of the logo was not made by me, and for legal reasons I have to put this here:

##Font

The Font we're using is [Orbitron Light](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Orbitron) by [Matt McInerney](http://matt.cc/). It's super nice.
