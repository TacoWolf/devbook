##TacoWolf Design Standards

At TacoWolf, we like to look pretty, so we adhere to these standards.

##Fonts

Here at TacoWolf we like to use [Sans-serif Fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif "Sans-serif on Wikipedia"). We believe that Sans-serif is cool and it lets us live in the future, and not in the past. (I mean, who uses Serif fonts anymore? Exactly.)

###Primary

You know what looks really good? [Raleway](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway "Raleway on Google Fonts"). We here at TacoWolf live for Raleway's simplicity and readability. It's our aesthetic, you could say.

*<small> Look at that. Shit's nice. </small>*

If you want to use a font in any of TacoWolf's websites or documents, you best be using Raleway. Otherwise, get out.

###Secondary

Alright, can't use Raleway for some reason? Fine. I get you. You're a rebel. But still, use something nice. We think of fonts like [Droid Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans "Droid Sans on Google Fonts") for secondary fonts.

If you REALLY can't use Raleway or Droid Sans, please use Arial.

TacoWolf's color palette is supposed to remind you of the 80s and 90s with it's really cool dark terminal feeling, making you feel like a hacker or a programmer without knowing any code. We know how awesome it feels to be programmers, so we want others to feel the same way.  We feel like the whole `1337 hacker` aesthetic is pretty sweet, but we still want a sense of professionalism when presenting information. That's why when we make something, we'll use this color scheme to show it. Also, people who like dark color schemes will love it. Easier on the eyes.

####Background

We use ["Very dark gray"](http://www.perbang.dk/rgb/151515/ "Very dark gray on Perbang.dk") (`#151515`/`(21,21,21)`) for our backgrounds. As an alternative background to contrast, we use  ["Dark gray"](http://www.perbang.dk/rgb/2A2A2A/ "Very dark gray on Perbang.dk") (`#2A2A2A`/`(42,42,42)`).  

####Headings

Headings should jump out at you, y'know? They show information, and sum it up all in one fell swoop. We think that a ["Luminous vivid green"](http://www.perbang.dk/rgb/00FF00/ "Luminous vivid green on Perbang.dk") color lets headers jump out and makes text feel alive.

####Text
<center>![Light gray](http://i.imgur.com/R5l8pkV.png "#EEEEEE")</center>

We hold true that Text is one of the most important things that you can present, but we don't want to have it intrude.  That's why we use a ["Light gray"](http://www.perbang.dk/rgb/151515/ "Light gray on Perbang.dk")  (`#EEEEEE`/`(238,238,238)`) color for all of our not-header text.

####Highlight

We believe that text that you want highlighted should stand out from the rest. That's why ["Luminous vivid orange"](http://www.perbang.dk/rgb/FF8700/ "Luminous vivid orange on Perbang.dk")  (`#FF8700`/`(255,135,0)`) is the color we chose for highlighting text - it's bold, it's different and it gets the job done.
